Twin shadows - sorting layers

Cave example of layers:
Background - The actual background color texture
Background1 - Big cave holes/openings
Background2 - Rough shapes of the cave
Background3 - Far away ruins
Background near - Background that is close to the player. . No parallax
Background props - Various objects in the background, like stone slabs, torches, monoliths, etc.
Player - Player, enemies, interactable objects, etc.
Foreground - Stalactites, pillars, surfaces, water droplets

A huge constraint is that the lighting system only shines light on sprites put in Default (order in layer 0) or further back. If I want everything in the room to interact
with the lighting system they need to be put in Default or further back, which only leaves me with 3 layers to work with, which is not ideal.

List of Unity layers:
Background (Order in layer: -10)
- Background1 (Order in layer: -5)
- Background2 (Order in layer: 0)
- Background3 (Order in layer: 5)
- Background near (Order in layer: 10)
